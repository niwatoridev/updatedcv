          I’m an innate manager.

          Being part of different kind of activities related to leadership,
          teamwork and conflict resolution has been part of my life. I do really
          enjoy working with people and I consider myself an assertive young
          man.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 400px; margin-right: 400px; text-align: justify">
          I’ve taken all opportunities to organize and command classmates,
          teamwork, coworkers, school events, and even social activities as I
          really enjoy and make a good job at it. Learning from great
          entrepreneurs has always been in my mind.
        </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 400px; margin-right: 400px; text-align: justify">
          I am willing to work in a great company whose values related to growth
          based on people service, excellence, creativity, and human kindness
          are evident, being able to learn from the very basis.
